# Angular reactive forms demo
Because I like angular reactive forms I decided to dedicate a repo to play a little bit with and demo how easy we can:
- reuse common form parts/fields
- add/remove field validation based on other fields input
- separate validation logic from the template
- other benefits may come as I deep dive into it by using it in real projects
